<h1 align="center">Recipe Book</h1>

<p align="center">
I enjoy cooking and recently began exploring mocktails. I've collected ideas from all over and thought it would be a fun project to create a recipe book of sorts for storing my favorite mocktails in my usual minimal style. Photos and files in the repo use dummy data and images.
</p>
 
## Examples
####  Home Page
<p>- All recipes are displayed in a grid layout showcasing an image, name, category, and complexity.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img width="700" align="center" src="https://github.com/yahirRendon/recipe-book/blob/main/img/receipe-project-home.JPG" alt="home page"/>
</p>

####  Card
<p>- On click a recipe card expands to list ingredients, directions, notes, and source.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img width="700" align="center" src="https://github.com/yahirRendon/recipe-book/blob/main/img/receipe-project-card.JPG" alt="filter recipes"/>
</p>

####  Filter
<p>- All recipes can be filtered by various types such as citrus or tea.</p>

</p>

####  Search
<p>- All recipes can be searched by name, category, or tags listed in the json file.</p>
